## Getting Started
### Step 1:  Set up the Development Environment
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
* on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`
* on Linux (Ubuntu) use `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -`<br/>
`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`

Then install yarn globally
```
npm install yarn -g
```

And finally install Docker
* Installation instructions on [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)


### Step 2: Set up the Project
Fork this project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you can edit your database connection information among other stuff, but everything should really work out of the box.

Do it manually or run:
```
./bin/copy-env.sh
```

Then setup your application environment.
```
npm run setup
```

> This installs all dependencies with yarn. After that it migrates the database and seeds some test data into it. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Step 3: Serve your App
Go to the project dir and start your app with this npm script.
```
npm run serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the sever according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.


### Step 3b: Or serve your App using Docker
Build the docker image defined in Dockerfile and start the services.
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

> This starts two marketplace applications and two particl daemons for you.
> app1 cli: http://localhost:3100/cli, connecting to particl1 on port 52935
> app2 cli: http://localhost:3200/cli, connecting to particl2 on port 53935

## Scripts / Tasks
All script are defined in the package.json file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install
* Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting
* Run code quality analysis using `npm run lint`. This runs tslint.
* There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests
Black-box tests are run against the applications rpc-api, so you need to start the application for those to work.
Integration tests start the application container and do not require the application to be running.

* Run the unit tests using `npm test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
* Run the integration tests using `npm run test:integration:pretty` and don't forget to start your application.
* Run the black-box tests using `npm run test:black-box:pretty` and don't forget to start your application.
* To run just some certain test(s) try `TEST=Market* npm run test:integration:single`

### Running in dev mode
* Run `npm run serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
* The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Building the project and run it
* Run `npm run build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
* To start the built app located in `dist` use `npm start`.

### Database
* Run `npm run db:migrate` to migrate schema changes to the database
* Run `npm run db:migrate:rollback` to rollback one migration
* Run `npm run db:seed` to seed sample data into the database
* Run `npm run db:reset` to rollback all migrations and migrate any migration again
* Run `./bin/recreate-dbs.sh` to recreate dev/test databases

### Console
* To run your own created command enter `npm run console <command-name>`.
* This list all your created commands `npm run console:help`.

### Scaffolding Commands
All the templates for the commands are located in `src/console/templates`.

* `npm run console make:resource` - Generates a controller, service, requests, repo, model and a migration with CRUD operations.
* `npm run console make:controller` - Generates a controller.
* `npm run console make:service` - Generates a service.
* `npm run console make:command` - Generates a command.
* `npm run console make:factory` - Generates a factory.
* `npm run console make:messageprocessor` - Generates a messageprocessor.
* `npm run console make:repo` - Generates a repository.
* `npm run console make:model` - Generates a model with the props and configurations.
* `npm run console make:middleware` - Generates a basic middleware.
* `npm run console make:request` - Generates a basic request.
* `npm run console make:listener` - Generates a basic listener.
* `npm run console make:exception` - Generates a basic exception.
* `npm run console make:enum` - Generates a basic enum.
* `npm run console make:api-test` - Generates an api test.
* `npm run console make:integration-test` - Generates an integration test.
* `npm run console make:seed` - Generates a seeder.
* `npm run console update:targets` - Reads all the API files and generate a new `constants/Targets.ts` file out of it.

**Example**
```
$ npm run console make:service ExampleService
// -> creates `api/services/ExampleService.ts

$ npm run console make:model user
// -> creates `api/models/User.ts
```

### WEB CLI
* This CLI gives you easy access to the RPC commands.
* Run `npm run serve` to serve the app.
* Go to `http://localhost:3000/cli` to access the CLI.
* Type `help` to get a list of supported commands.


## IoC
Our IoC automatically looks through the `controllers`, `listeners` , `middlewares`, `services`,
`repositories`, `commands`, `factories`, `messageprocessors` and `models` folders in `src/api/` for files to bound automatically into the IoC - Container, so you have nothing to do.

**However it is very important to keep the naming right, because otherwise our IoC will not find your created files!!**


## API Routes
The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file. The route for the RPC API is `/api`.

| Route       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **/api/info** | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/api/docs** | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/status**   | Shows a small monitor page for the server |
| **/cli**      | Web based CLI to use the RPC commands |
| **/api/rpc**  | RPC Server endpoint |
